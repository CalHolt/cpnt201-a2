<h1>ROCK CLIMBING IS KINDA COOL</h1>

<h2>Rock climbing terminology</h2>

<p><em>"Did you see that flash?"</em>. Rock climbers tend to use terminology that can be hard to understand, its used <strong>constantly</strong> and its something you need to understand going into the sport.</p>

<p><strong>Flash</strong> is to ascend a route on the first attempt, but having obtained beta; with no beta, it is an on-sight.</p>

<ul>

  <h3>Route Ascent Terminology</h3>

    <li>In How to Rock Climb, John Long writes that for moderately skilled climbers simply getting to the top of a route is not enough- how one gets to the top matters.[9] Within free climbing, there are several distinctions given to ascents.</li>
  
    <li>On-sighting a route requires that the climber ascend cleanly (without any falls or rest with the assistance of artificial equipment) on their first attempt without any foreknowledge.
  
    Flashing also requires a clean ascent on the first try, though the climber has previous information about the route (often called beta). This may include talking about the route with other climbers or observing others climb the route.</li>
  
    <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redpoint_(climbing)">Redpointing</a> means to make a successful free ascent of the route after having previously tried it. This may include multiple days or even years of "working" the route to learn the specific sequence required.</li>
    
    <li>Pinkpointing means to make a successful free ascent of the route after having previously tried it, with protection (or "pro") such as quickdraws or trad equipment pre-placed on the route.
    </li>

</ul>
